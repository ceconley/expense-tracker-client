# Expense Tracker

![Pic of App](https://github.com/ceconley/expense-tracker-client/blob/master/public/ET.png "App")

This is a single page application that tracks expenses. Users can create, update, delete, see 1 and see all expenses. They can only access expenses that are tied to their specific user id and no other user's expenses. This SPA runs off a custom API that was built with Rails and PostgreSQL.

### Future Versions
In future iterations I will add functionality to allow users to track on an organization level.  Users will belong to organizations and organizations will have many users.  I will also add logic and functions so users can further sort and analyze their data.

### Planning
I started my planning by drawing and ERD and wire frames.  Then I moved on to creating user stories.  After that I turned my user stories into psuedo code.  I found that in previous projects, when I was stuck on something, I would go and alter HTML or CSS.  This time I made sure that I saw issues to their end and stayed closer to my timeline and order of tasks.  This helped me stay on track.

### Wireframe

### User stories
- As a user I would like to create and account with email and password.
- As a user I would like to login with my credentials so my data is secure.
- As a user I would like to be able to update my password for increased security.
- As a user I would like to logout when I am done with a session, so no one else can access my data.
- As a user I would like to add expense data for storage.
- As a user I would like to be able to edit expense data for accuracy.
- As a user I would like to delete expense data, so unnecessary data doesn't ruin my set.
- As a user I would like to to be able to see all my expense data.
- As a user I would like to be able to see individual expense entries.
